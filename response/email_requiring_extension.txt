Dear Alex Groce,


I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request an extension for the rebuttal period for our recent submission, Software Product Line Engineering via Software Transplantation TOSEM-2023-0120 authored by Oliveira de Souza, Leandro; Barr, Earl; Petke, Justyna; Santana de Almeida, Eduardo; Silveira, Paulo, currently under review.

Given the complexity and depth of the reviewersâ€™ comments, we need more time comprehensively address them. We aim to address all the comments thoroughly and ensure the highest quality in our responses.

We believe we can do so by the end of February.  Could you please extend the deadline until then?


Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your response.

Best regards,
